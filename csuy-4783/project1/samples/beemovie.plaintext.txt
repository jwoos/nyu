your proof where is the evidence show me the smoking gun hold it your honor you want a smoking gun here is your smoking gun what is that its a bee smoker what this this harmless little contraption

time barry who are you wearing my sweater is ralph lauren and i have no pants what if montgomerys right what do you mean weve been living the bee way a long time million years oongratulations on your victory what will you demand as a settlement first well demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with every last drop we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly badbreath stink machine were all aware of what they do in the woods wait for my signal take him out hell have nauseous for a few hours

things its notjust flowers fruits vegetables they all need bees thats our whole sat test right there take away produce that affects the entire animal kingdom and then of course the human species so if

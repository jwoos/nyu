Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the JubJub bird and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand.
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So, rested he by the TumTum tree
And stood a while in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock with eyes of flame
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood
And burbled as it came.

One two, one two, and through and through
His vorpal blade went snicker snack.
He left it dead and with its head
He went gallumphing back.

And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy
Callou, Callay, oh frabjous day
He chortled in his joy.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the JubJub bird and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!

<h4><a name="Task1" id="Task1"></a>Task 1.</h4>
<p>
  Read <a href="rec06-000-hierarchy-only.cpp">this code</a> and draw
  the UML diagram for it. </p>
<p>Recall that in a UML diagram you represent a class with a box with the class name in it.<br>
  Association is shown by a plain line.<br>
  Containment is shown by a line with an diamond &quot;pointing&quot; from the contained class to the class that contains it (diamond next to this box).<br>
  Ineritance (generalization) is shown by an arrown pointing from the derived (child) class to the base (parent) class. </p>
<p><a href="rec06-AK.html#Task1">Answer key Task 1.</a> </p>
<h4><a name="Task2" id="Task2"></a>Task 2.</h4>
<p>We need to add the number of pages to this hierarchy.<br>
  Which of these objects should have this data member <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">unsigned numberOfPages;</font> ?<br>
  <br>
  In your IDE modify  <a href="rec06-000-hierarchy-only.cpp">this code</a> and place this data member EVERYWHERE you think it should go. <br>
  You should have code that looks <a href="rec06-001-num-pgs-000.cpp">like this</a>.<br>
  <strong><font size="+1">  Do NOT just copy this code - try to write your own version first and then look at solution provided to see if you got it right. </font></strong></p>
<h4><a name="Task3" id="Task3"></a>Task 3.</h4>
<p>Is this correct?<br>
  No.<br>
  When developing an inheritance tree, the concept is to &quot;move&quot; data member and methods as far &quot;up&quot; the tree as possible.<br>
  Now fix this.<br>
  You should have code <a href="rec06-002-correct-pgs.cpp">like this</a>. <strong><font size="+1">Again, do NOT just copy this code </font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 4.</h4>
<p>How does that number of pages data member get initialized?<br>
  Which class is responsible for doing this?<br>
  Try putting the constructor ONLY in the base class - there's where it seems it ought to be, right? <br>
  That's where the data member is, right? <br>
  Should this compile? (Look at the tester/main code) </p>
<p>You should have code that looks like <a href="rec06-003-just-base-ctor.cpp">this</a>.  <strong><font size="+1">Again, copying is not learning!</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 5.</h4>
<p>Each child class must call the constructor for it's direct base class.<br>
  Note that the Novel and TextBook classes should not also try to initialize their PrintedMaterial class portions.<br>
  Now you should have: this <a href="rec06-004-ctor-correct.cpp">corrected code</a>. <strong><font size="+1"> copying?</font></strong><br>
  Try adding to Novel and TextBook the constructor for PrintedMaterial - should this compile?<br>
  (Be sure to remove these constructor calls before going on to Task 6.<strong><font size="+1"></font></strong><br>
</p>
<h4>Task 6.</h4>
<p>Where should the following method go?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>void displayNumPages() const { cout &lt;&lt; numberOfPages; }</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about how far up the tree...? </p>
<p>And test your method on the objects <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">t</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">n</font>. </p>
<p><a href="rec06-005-dispNumLOgsInBase.cpp">solution code</a> <strong><font size="+1">(you know the drill)</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 7.</h4>
<p>TextBooks also have anindex and thus a <code>numOfIndexPages</code> data member.<br>
This should be shown in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><code>displayNumPages</code></font> in the... where? Which classes? </p>
<p>Note that for TextBooks, there will be two values output.</p>
<p><a href="rec06-006-bad-private.cpp">Here's a solution</a>. <strong><font size="+1">(yes, you can copy this one!!!)</font></strong><br>
  Figure out what's wrong with it.</p>
<h4>Task 8.</h4>
<p>Fix it (from the previous Task).<br>
  You should use a call to a base class' methoed
(<a href="rec06-007-indexpages.cpp">fixed</a>)  <strong><font size="+1">(copy nyet!)</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 9.</h4>
<p>Now we consider that we want to maintain a collection of these printy-things we created. </p>
<p>How?<br>
  Of course - a vector.<br>
  A vector of what?<br>
  Lets consider <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><code>vector&lt;PrintedMaterial&gt;</code></font>.</p>
<p><br>
  We can test if this will work without working with a vector - yet.<br>
  This is a good development practice: try something little and get it working before putting that little thing into a bigger problem.<br>
  If you can't get it to work by itself in a simple context, it will be harder to solve a more complex problem with non-working code! <br>
  Recall that <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><code>push_back</code></font> makes a COPY of the thing stored.<br>
  It's like an assignment statement inside the vector.<br>
  So we can test that this assignment will work in a vector, without a vector, by trying to directly assign a derived class object (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TextBook</font>) to a base class object (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial</font>). <br>
  The base class object on the rhs of the assignment operators is used as a model of a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial</font> object being placed into a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">vector&lt;PrintedMaterial&gt;</font>).<br>
  After the assignment, we can ask that base class object to do its <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">displayNumPages</font> method.<br>
  So do that: assign a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TextBook</font> object to a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial</font> object and ask it to <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">displayNumPages</font>.</p>
<p>Do that and see what happens.<br>
This would be the code you would add: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>PrintedMaterial</code> <code>pm = t; // like putting a t into a vector of PrintedMaterials<br>
    pm.displayNumPages();</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is SLICING in action.</p>
<p>(<a href="rec06-009-PM-obj-assgnd-T.cpp">code</a>) <strong><font size="+1">(no, no, no!)</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 10.</h4>
<p>Oh dear! t didn't display like a <code>TextBook</code> - it displayed like a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><code>PrintedMaterial</code></font> object! <br>
Slicing!</p>
<p>OK, lets. try this with pointers.<br>
  <br>
  Some of you may recall from class that we have used pointer-to-base-class type pointers to invoke... something (can't remember).<br>
  [<em>Polymorphism</em>, also know in C++ as the &quot;<em>virtual mechanism</em>&quot;]<br>
  <br>
  A <code>vector&lt;PrintedMaterial*&gt;</code> is supposed to solve this problem:.<br>
  [Don't forget to use the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-&gt;</font> operator to dereference a pointer in this case!] </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <code>PrintedMaterial* pmPtr;<br>
    pmPtr = &amp;t;<br>
    // instead of putting an actual PrintedMaterial<br>
    // object into the vector, we put a pointer to<br>
    // a PrintedMaterial object (t) into a vector<br>
    // of pointers-to-PrintedMaterial<br>
    // (that is, pointers to the Base class)<br>
    // we'll be &quot;managing&quot; our objects by using<br>
    // 
    pointers to PrintedMaterial values.</code></p>
  <p> <code>pmPtr-&gt;displayNumPages(); </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  <br>
  (<a href="rec06-010-prt-PM-wo-virt.cpp">code</a>) 
  <strong><font size="+1">(still no, no, no!)</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 11.</h4>
<p>Oh dear!</p>
<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TextBook</font> object used to show the number of index pages.<br>
  Why did it stop?<br>
  It didn't!<br>
  We were not getting a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TextBook</font> object when we dereferenced a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial*</font> value.<br>
  But (you'll complain) we STORED the address of a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TextBook</font> object in that <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial</font> pointer variable (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pmPtr</font>).<br>
  Yes, you did.<br>
  But the derefence works like this:<br>
  When you dereference a pointer to an plain old int you get an int. <br>
  When you dereference a pointer to an plain old Elephant you get an Elephant.<br>
  When you dereference a pointer to an base class in an inheritance hierarchy which holds the address of an object of a type that was publicly derived from the base class, you get the BASE part of the derived class! (whew! so many words!)</p>
<p>So is there a way to get the derived class' <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">displayNumPages()</font>?<br>
YES!!!</p>
<p><em>polymorhphism</em> (using the virtual mechanism) (is there such as word as 'virtuality'?)<br>
  Here's the other way to say things (with even more words) :<br>
When you dereference a pointer to an base class which has a virtual method in an inheritance hierarchy which holds the address of an object of a type that was publicly derived from the base class, you get the DERIVED class. (Way too many words but you must understand the concept).</p>
<p>A place that can hold a Base class pointer value can hold a pointer to ANY object that inherits from Base.<br>
  The virtual mechanism is only invoked when pointer to base classes are used (or reference to base class in function parameters).<br>
  So you must use the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">-&gt;</font> to invoke the virtual mechanism.<br>
</p>
<p>Make the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">displayNumPages()</font>virtual and see how that works. </p>
<p> NOTE even without writing &quot;virtual&quot; this overriden method IS virtual.<br>
  &quot;Viruality&quot; cannot be removed once installed<br>
</p>
<p>Write code that adds a virtual version of <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">DisplayNumPages</font> in the correct places.</p>
<p>(<a href="rec06-011-virt.cpp">code</a>) 
<strong><font size="+1">(and even now still no, no, no!)</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 12.</h4>
<p>Recall that the virtual mechanism works with either pointers to base class or reference to base class.<br>
  Write a standalone function named <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">displayNumberOfPages<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font></font>that will display ANY type inherited from PrintedMaterial.<br>
  (Do not use pointers for this.)</p>
<p>(<a href="rec06-012-virt-ref.cpp">code</a>) 
<strong><font size="+1">(not even this last one!)</font></strong></p>
<h4>Task 13.</h4>
<p>
  Should it be OK to create an obect of type <font face="Courier New,
  Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial</font>?<br>  What is
  a <font face="Courier New, Courier,
  monospace">PrintedMaterial</font> really?</p>
<p>
  But if we don't want to allow <font face="Courier New, Courier,
  monospace">PrintedMaterial</font> things, don't we still want to
  make sure that any object that derived from <font face="Courier New,
  Courier, monospace">PrintedMaterial</font> MUST have
  a <font face="Courier New, Courier,
  mono">displayNumPages()</font>method?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So how?<br>
  <em>pure virtual methods</em></p>
<p>
  Making a method pure make the class it is an <em>abstract</em> class
- that means that C++ will not allow an object of that type to be
created.<br>  It also means that any class deriving from that abstract
class <strong>must</strong> override that pure virutal method to
create a <em>concrete</em> class - that means that C++ will allow
objects to be created.<br>  (A concrete class is a class with no pure
virtual methods - all pureness has been overridden.)</p>
<p>
  The syntax for making a virtual method be a pure virtual method is
  to add the designation &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
  monospace">= 0</font>&quot; after the closing parenthsis of the
  parameter list (or after the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
  monospace">const</font> if it's an accessor). A pure virual method
  can have a body or it can just be a declaraion. Which to choose
  depends on what such an abstract class could do. Our class is
  incredibly simple and the display method can do the display from
  this abstract class so we'll use a body. Most of the time, there is
  no body in a pure virtuall method because the class is SO abstract
  that it would be impossible to know what to write as the code in the
  body. In all of these forms, the class becomes abstract and a child
  class must override (that is rewrite) the pure virtual method (to
  remove the pureness).</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">void nonConstMethodDeclar( ) = 0; // the normal way <br>
void constMethodDeclar( ) const = 0; // the normal way <br>
</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">void nonConstMethodWithBody( ) = 0 {} // INCORRECT!  Even though your compiler may accept it. <br>
void constMethodWithBody( ) const = 0 {}  // INCORRECT!  Even though your compiler may accept it.
</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"></font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"></font></p>
<p>
  The normal design reason for pure virtual is to enforce that all
  children will have this method - and that only they can completely
  define it because only they know the specifics of themselves.<br>
  Move a method so far up the inheritance tree that you can no longer
  write it! - that's where a pure virtual method should go.</p>
<p>
  Write code to make the base class' method <font face="Courier New,
  Courier, monospace">displayNumPages</font> pure virtual and see what
  error occur in your code. </p>
<p>(<a href="rec06-013-abstract-first-try.cpp">code</a>) [won't compile - why?] </p>
<h4>Task 14.</h4>
<p>
  The problem is that we are now trying to create (instantiate)
  abstract classes and C++ won't allow it.<br>  One of those classes
  we want to make uncreateable (PrintedMaterial) but the others must
  have written <font face="Courier New, Courier,
  mono">displayNumPages()</font>methods.</p>
<p>
  Why did <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TextBook</font>
  not have a compilation problem? (It -did- override the pure virtual
  method.) </p>
<p>
  Do whatever needs to be done so that we have a nice clean
  compile.<br>  You can remove those attempts to create objects that
  we don't want to be able to create. (And any other code you've
  already tested.)<br>
  (<a href="rec06-014-abstract-fixed.cpp">code</a>) </p>
<h4>Task 15.</h4>
<p>This is what we'd like to have done in the very beginning.</p>
<p>Now that we've figured out how to &quot;store a bunch of similar-in-an-heritance-way things&quot; - by actually storing them as pointers to their base classes, let's try it.<br>
  Create a vector for all the createable objects and then loop through the vector asking each of the &quot;stored&quot; things to do their <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">displayNumPages()</font>method. </p>
<p>(<a href="rec06-015-vector.cpp">code</a>)</p>
